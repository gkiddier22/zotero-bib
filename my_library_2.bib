CMB-S4 will dramatically advance cosmological studies by crossing critical thresholds in the search for the B-mode polarization signature of primordial gravitational waves, in the determination of the number and masses of the neutrinos, in the search for evidence of new light relics, in constraining the nature of dark energy, and in testing general relativity on large scales.},

This finding displaces a century-long presumption of a 365-day solar calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism with a 354-day lunar calendar and may inform a fundamental question of the number and type of calendars used in Ancient Egypt.},

  abstract = {The ESA's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the CMB and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the SZ effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derived from CMB data and that derived from SZ data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak.},

In February{\textasciitilde}2015, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the second set of cosmology products based on data from the entire Planck mission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the data products in the release, as well as the associated cosmological and astrophysical science results and papers. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues of Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and Galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulations of signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methods and assessment of uncertainties. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data are described, as well as a CMB lensing likelihood. Scientific results include cosmological parameters deriving from CMB power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well as constraints on inflation, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, dark energy, and modified gravity.},

  abstract = {The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new cosmic microwave background experiment being built on Cerro Toco in Chile, due to begin observations in the early 2020s. We describe the scientific goals of the experiment, motivate the design, and forecast its performance. SO will measure the temperature and polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands: 27, 39, 93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz. The initial configuration of SO will have three small-aperture 0.5-m telescopes (SATs) and one large-aperture 6-m telescope (LAT), with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers. Our key science goals are to characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number of relativistic species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from a cosmological constant, improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, and constrain the duration of reionization. The SATs will target the largest angular scales observable from Chile, mapping {\textasciitilde}10\% of the sky to a white noise level of 2 \${\textbackslash}mu\$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, to measure the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio, \$r\$, at a target level of \${\textbackslash}sigma(r)=0.003\$. The LAT will map {\textasciitilde}40\% of the sky at arcminute angular resolution to an expected white noise level of 6 \${\textbackslash}mu\$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, overlapping with the majority of the LSST sky region and partially with DESI. With up to an order of magnitude lower polarization noise than maps from the Planck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain cosmological parameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of the microwave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and will aid in delensing the large-angle polarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The survey will also provide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000 extragalactic sources.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a detailed description of the CamSpec likelihood which has been used to analyse Planck temperature and polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background since the first Planck data release. We have created a number of likelihoods using a range of Galactic sky masks and different methods of temperature foreground cleaning. Our most powerful likelihood uses 80 percent of the sky in temperature and polarization. Our results show that the six-parameter LCDM cosmology provides an excellent fit to the Planck data. There is no evidence for statistically significant internal tensions in the Planck TT, TE and EE spectra computed for different frequency combinations. We present evidence that the tendencies for the Planck temperature power spectra to favour a lensing amplitude A\_L{$>$}1 and positive spatial curvature are caused by statistical fluctuations in the temperature power spectra. Using our statistically most powerful likelihood, we find that the A\_L parameter differs from unity at no more than the 2.2 sigma level. We find no evidence for anomalous shifts in cosmological parameters with multipole range. In fact, we show that the combined TTTEEE likelihood over the restricted multipole range 2-800 gives cosmological parameters for the base LCDM cosmology that are very close to those derived from the full multipole range 2-2500. We present revised constraints on a few extensions of the base LCDM cosmology, focussing on the sum of neutrino masses, number of relativistic species and the tensor-scalar ratio. The results presented here show that the Planck data are remarkably consistent between detector-sets, frequencies and sky area. We find no evidence in our analysis that cosmological parameters determined from the CamSpec likelihood are affected to any significant degree by systematic errors in the Planck data (abridged).},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that maximum likelihood estimators must be used to provide optimal estimates of power spectra. Since such estimators require require of order N\_d{\textasciicircum}3 operations they are computationally prohibitive for N\_d greater than a few tens of thousands. Because of this, a large and inhomogeneous literature exists on approximate methods of power spectrum estimation. These range from manifestly sub-optimal, but computationally fast methods, to near optimal but computationally expensive methods. Furthermore, much of this literature concentrates on the power spectrum estimates rather than the equally important problem of deriving an accurate covariance matrix. In this paper, I consider the problem of estimating the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies from large data sets. Various analytic results on power spectrum estimators are derived, or collated from the literature, and tested against numerical simulations. An unbiased hybrid estimator is proposed that combines a maximum likelihood estimator at low multipoles and pseudo-C\_{\textbackslash}ell estimates at high multipoles. The hybrid estimator is computationally fast, nearly optimal over the full range of multipoles, and returns an accurate and nearly diagonal covariance matrix for realistic experimental configurations (provided certain conditions on the noise properties of the experiment are satisfied). It is argued that, in practice, computationally expensive methods that approximate the N\_d{\textasciicircum}3 maximum likelihood solution are unlikely to improve on the hybrid estimator, and may actually perform worse. The results presented here can be generalised to CMB polarization and to power spectrum estimation using other types of data, such as galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing.},

  abstract = {We describe and implement an exact, flexible, and computationally efficient algorithm for joint component separation and CMB power spectrum estimation, building on a Gibbs sampling framework. Two essential new features are 1) conditional sampling of foreground spectral parameters, and 2) joint sampling of all amplitude-type degrees of freedom (e.g., CMB, foreground pixel amplitudes, and global template amplitudes) given spectral parameters. Given a parametric model of the foreground signals, we estimate efficiently and accurately the exact joint foreground-CMB posterior distribution, and therefore all marginal distributions such as the CMB power spectrum or foreground spectral index posteriors. The main limitation of the current implementation is the requirement of identical beam responses at all frequencies, which restricts the analysis to the lowest resolution of a given experiment. We outline a future generalization to multi-resolution observations. To verify the method, we analyse simple models and compare the results to analytical predictions. We then analyze a realistic simulation with properties similar to the 3-yr WMAP data, downgraded to a common resolution of 3 degree FWHM. The results from the actual 3-yr WMAP temperature analysis are presented in a companion Letter.},

We detect correlations between the temperature and polarization maps significant at more than 10 standard deviations. The correlations are present in all WMAP frequency bands with similar amplitude from 23 to 94 GHz, and are consistent with a superposition of a CMB signal with a weak foreground. The fitted CMB component is robust against different data combinations and fitting techniques. On small angular scales theta {$<$} 5 deg, the WMAP data show the temperature-polarization correlation expected from adiabatic perturbations in the temperature power spectrum. The data for l {$>$} 20 agree well with the signal predicted solely from the temperature power spectra, with no additional free parameters. We detect excess power on large angular scales (theta {$>$} 10 deg) compared to predictions based on the temperature power spectra alone. The excess power is well described by reionization at redshift 11 {$<$} z\_r {$<$} 30 at 95\% confidence, depending on the ionization history. A model-independent fit to reionization optical depth yields results consistent with the best-fit LambdaCDM model, with best fit value tau = 0.17 +- 0.04 at 68\% confidence, including systematic and foreground uncertainties. This value is larger than expected given the detection of a Gunn-Peterson trough in the absorption spectra of distant quasars, and implies that the universe has a complex ionization history: WMAP has detected the signal from an early epoch of reionization.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission               Planck               measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5               {$\sigma$}               level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ``base {$\Lambda$}CDM'' in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density {\textohm}               c               h               2               \;=\;0.120\>{\textpm}\>0.001, baryon density {\textohm}               b               h               2               \;=\;0.0224\>{\textpm}\>0.0001, scalar spectral index               n               s               \;=\;0.965\>{\textpm}\>0.004, and optical depth               {$\tau$}               \;=\;0.054\>{\textpm}\>0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100               {\texttheta}               *               \;=\;1.0411\>{\textpm}\>0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant               H               0               \;=\;(67.4\>{\textpm}\>0.5)\hspace{0.166em}\hspace{0.166em}km\hspace{0.166em}s               -1               \hspace{0.166em}Mpc               -1               ; matter density parameter {\textohm}               m               \;=\;0.315\>{\textpm}\>0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude               {$\sigma$}               8               \;=\;0.811\>{\textpm}\>0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be               N               eff               \;=\;2.99\>{\textpm}\>0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction               N               eff               \;=\;3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to {$\sum$}               m                                {$\nu$}                              \;{$<$} \;0.12\hspace{0.166em}\hspace{0.166em}eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base {$\Lambda$}CDM at over 2               {$\sigma$}               , which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the {$\Lambda$}CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, {\textohm}                                K                              \;=\;0.001\>{\textpm}\>0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be               w               0               \;=\;-1.03\>{\textpm}\>0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio               r               0.002               \;{$<$} \;0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The               Planck               base-{$\Lambda$}CDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6               {$\sigma$}               , tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the               Planck               data.},

  abstract = {We describe the legacy               Planck               cosmic microwave background (CMB) likelihoods derived from the 2018 data release. The overall approach is similar in spirit to the one retained for the 2013 and 2015 data release, with a hybrid method using different approximations at low (               {$\ell$}               \;{$<$} \;30) and high (               {$\ell$}               \;{$\geq$}\;30) multipoles, implementing several methodological and data-analysis refinements compared to previous releases. With more realistic simulations, and better correction and modelling of systematic effects, we can now make full use of the CMB polarization observed in the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) channels. The low-multipole               EE               cross-spectra from the 100 GHz and 143 GHz data give a constraint on the {$\Lambda$}CDM reionization optical-depth parameter               {$\tau$}               to better than 15\% (in combination with the               TT               low-               {$\ell$}               data and the high-               {$\ell$}               temperature and polarization data), tightening constraints on all parameters with posterior distributions correlated with               {$\tau$}               . We also update the weaker constraint on               {$\tau$}               from the joint TEB likelihood using the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) channels, which was used in 2015 as part of our baseline analysis. At higher multipoles, the CMB temperature spectrum and likelihood are very similar to previous releases. A better model of the temperature-to-polarization leakage and corrections for the effective calibrations of the polarization channels (i.e., the polarization efficiencies) allow us to make full use of polarization spectra, improving the {$\Lambda$}CDM constraints on the parameters               {\texttheta}               MC               ,               {$\omega$}               c               ,               {$\omega$}               b               , and               H               0               by more than 30\%, and n               s               by more than 20\% compared to TT-only constraints. Extensive tests on the robustness of the modelling of the polarization data demonstrate good consistency, with some residual modelling uncertainties. At high multipoles, we are now limited mainly by the accuracy of the polarization efficiency modelling. Using our various tests, simulations, and comparison between different high-multipole likelihood implementations, we estimate the consistency of the results to be better than the 0.5\hspace{0.166em}               {$\sigma$}               level on the {$\Lambda$}CDM parameters, as well as classical single-parameter extensions for the joint likelihood (to be compared to the 0.3\hspace{0.166em}               {$\sigma$}               levels we achieved in 2015 for the temperature data alone on {$\Lambda$}CDM only). Minor curiosities already present in the previous releases remain, such as the differences between the best-fit {$\Lambda$}CDM parameters for the               {$\ell$}               \;{$<$} \;800 and               {$\ell$}               \;{$>$} \;800 ranges of the power spectrum, or the preference for more smoothing of the power-spectrum peaks than predicted in {$\Lambda$}CDM fits. These are shown to be driven by the temperature power spectrum and are not significantly modified by the inclusion of the polarization data. Overall, the legacy               Planck               CMB likelihoods provide a robust tool for constraining the cosmological model and represent a reference for future CMB observations.},
